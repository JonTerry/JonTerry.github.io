# Rails

I currently have Covid, so this is going to be pretty tangential. Might delete later.

I've been deliberating pretty hard, and I think I'm going to commit to focusing on RoR. Prior to this, I'd been reading through the GoF book, as well as Grokking Algorithms, The Rust Book, and Learning Go. While I'm still planning on finishing those titles eventually, I think that Rails might give me the immediate satisfaction of having made something.

There are tons of frameworks to choose from. I know some Python, so Django seemed like it might be an interesting choice. I also thought about going down the PHP road, since Laravel seems to be popular at the moment. I eventually came to the conclusions that I'm too distractable. My attention should, first and foremost, be directed towards understanding Rails. I believe it'll force me to develop good coding habits.

Hopefully I'll be able to incorporate some nifty front-end techniques. I've been watching Hyperplexed on YouTube, and I think it'd be cool to do some creative front-end stuff down the road.

Covid sucks, but it's been nice sitting around reading about frameworks for the past few days.
