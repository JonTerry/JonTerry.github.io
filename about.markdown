# Hello World

My name is Jon Terry. I currently have zero credentials that would qualify me for employment in anything related to computer science. I plan on this changing, and I plan on using this platform to document my journey.

While I'm virtually starting at zero, I do have the Google IT certificate, some web dev experience (thanks to [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)), and miscellaneous half-baked projects in various languages. I've used Python to automate the boring stuff at my last job, and I've written various things in Go. I'm currently reading the GoF book, Learning Go, Grokking Algorithms, and The Rust Book. I'm not focussing on a particular language at this point, because I'm stuck in an exploration phase. Oh, and I've lately become interested in Ruby.

I may go back to school for a CS degree, but my goal is to be working in tech/IT in the next 2 years. I also spend a lot of time learning about topics related to cyber security. Hopefully I'll be able to scoop up some certificates, find employment, and slowly build up a respectable programming portfolio. I'd ultimately like to code for a living...

I'm going to delete this soon. I have covid brain, so I'm just brain-dumping as a way to fill up some white space.
